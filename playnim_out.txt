NIM with heaps [3, 2, 1] using players ab and ab and heuristic False
Initial state: GameState(to_move=1, utility=0, board=[3, 2, 1], moves=[])
Player 1 moves (0, 1) ==> GameState(to_move=2, utility=0, board=[2, 2, 1], moves=[])
Player 2 moves (2, 1) ==> GameState(to_move=1, utility=0, board=[2, 2, 0], moves=[])
Player 1 moves (0, 1) ==> GameState(to_move=2, utility=0, board=[1, 2, 0], moves=[])
Player 2 moves (1, 1) ==> GameState(to_move=1, utility=0, board=[1, 1, 0], moves=[])
Player 1 moves (0, 1) ==> GameState(to_move=2, utility=0, board=[0, 1, 0], moves=[])
Player 2 moves (1, 1) ==> GameState(to_move=1, utility=-inf, board=[0, 0, 0], moves=[])
Player 2 wins
